            <h3>Parliamentary Form of Government:</h3>

            <h3>9. How was the Indian Constitution made? Or How constitution of India is formed?</h3>
            <p>The long experience of authoritarian rule under the colonial state convinced Indians that free India should be a democracy in which everyone should be treated equally and be allowed to participate in government. What remained to be done then was to work out the ways in which a democratic government would be set up in India and the rules that would determine its functioning. This was done not by one person but by a group of around 300 people who became members of the Constituent Assembly in 1946 and who met periodically for the next three years to write India’s Constitution. Between December 1946 and November 1949, the Constituent Assembly drafted a constitution for independent India.</p>

            <h3>11. Write a brief note on the struggle for freedom in Nepal.</h3>
            <p>The country of Nepal has witnessed several people’s struggles for democracy. There was a people’s struggle in 1990 that established democracy that lasted for 12 years until 2002. In October 2002, King Gyanendra, citing the Maoist uprising in the countryside as his reason, began taking over different aspects of the government with the army’s assistance. The King then finally took over as the head of government in February 2005. In November 2005, the Maoists joined other political parties to sign a 12-point agreement. This agreement signalled to the larger public an imminent return to democracy and peace. In 2006, this people’s movement for democracy began gaining immense force. It repeatedly refused the small concessions that the King made and finally in April 2006 the King restored the Third Parliament and asked the political parties to form a government. In 2007, Nepal adopted an interim Constitution.</p>

            <h3>12. In each of the following situations, identify the minority. Write one reason why you think it is important to respect the views of the minority in each of these situations. (a) In a school with 30 teachers, 20 of them are male. (b) In a city, 5 per cent of the population are Buddhists. (c) In a factory mess for all employees, 80 per cent are vegetarians. (d) In a class of 50 students, 40 belong to more well-off families.</h3>
            <p>(a) Female teachers are in the minority – It is important to respect the views of the minority so that they do not feel left out or underpowered by majority.</p>
            <p>(b) Buddhists are in the minority – It is important to respect the views of the minority because every individual has the right to follow the religion of his choice.</p>
            <p>(c) Non – vegetarians are in the minority – It is important to respect the views of the minority because the food a person eats is his personal wish and so he should have the freedom to eat what he wants.</p>
            <p>(d) The underprivileged are in minority – It is important to respect the views of the minority because citizens cannot be discriminated on the bases rich or poor.</p>

            <h3>13. Look at the wordings of the two documents given below. The first column is from the 1990 Nepal Constitution. The second column is from the more recent Interim Constitution of Nepal. 1990 Constitution of Nepal Part 7: Executive 2007 Interim Constitution Part 5: Executive Article 35: Executive Power: The executive power of the Kingdom of Nepal shall be vested in His Majesty and the Council of Ministers. Article 37: Executive Power: The executive power of Nepal shall be vested in the Council of Ministers.</h3>
            <p><strong>1990 Constitution of Nepal:</strong> In 1990, Nepal was a monarchy. The previous Constitution of Nepal, which had been adopted in 1990, reflected the fact that the final authority rested with the King.</p>
            <p><strong>2007 Interim Constitution:</strong> According to the Interim constitution drafted in 2007, the executive powers of Nepal are in the hands of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>Nepal needs a new Constitution today because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nepal, by moving from a monarchy to a democratic government, needs to change all its constitutive rules in order to usher in a new society.</li>
                <li>The previous Constitution does not reflect the ideals of the country that they want Nepal to be, and that they have fought for.</li>

            <h3>14. Listed below are the key features of the Indian Constitution. Write two sentences, in your own words, on why you think this feature is important:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Federalism:</strong> This refers to the existence of more than one level of government in the country. In India, we have governments at the state level and at the centre. Panchayati Raj is the third tier of government. Under federalism, the states are not merely agents of the federal government but draw their authority from the Constitution as well. All persons in India are governed by laws and policies made by each of these levels of government.</li>
                <li><strong>Separation of Powers:</strong> According to the Constitution, there are three organs of government. These are the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. In order to prevent the misuse of power by any one branch of government, the Constitution says that each of these organs should exercise different powers. Through this, each organ acts as a check on the other organs of government and this ensures the balance of power between all three.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundamental Rights:</strong> Fundamental Rights guarantees the rights of individuals against the State as well as against other individuals. It also guarantees the rights of minorities against the majority.</li>
                <li><strong>Parliamentary Form of Government:</strong> The Constitution of India guarantees universal adult suffrage for all citizens. This would help encourage a democratic mindset and break the clutches of traditional caste, class and gender hierarchies. This means that the people of India have a direct role in electing their representatives. Also, every citizen of the country, irrespective of his/her social background, can also contest in elections. These representatives are accountable to the people.</li>
